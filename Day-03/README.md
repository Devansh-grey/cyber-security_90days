# Virtualization with VMware: A Beginner's Guide

## 1. What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as a computer system, server, or storage device, that can run multiple operating systems (OS) or applications concurrently on the same physical hardware. This is achieved by using software called a hypervisor, which abstracts the underlying hardware resources and allocates them to different virtual machines (VMs). 

With virtualization, you can run multiple VMs with different OSs (like Linux, Windows, macOS, etc.) on a single physical machine, optimizing resource usage and enhancing flexibility for testing, development, and security purposes.
